# Multivariate-Multistep-LSTM

This repo contains a simple Jupyter Notebook which shows a technique of how to preprocess multivariate Time-Series Data so that it could be used for multi-step prediction.

A simmple LSTM model was also created to demonstrate the results and how the data could be fed in it.
